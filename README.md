# 2048 (Java Swing)

## Summary
A desktop version of **2048** built in Java with Swing. Use the arrow keys to slide tiles on a 4×4 grid; when two tiles with the same value collide, they merge into one. Keep merging to reach **2048**.

## Features Included
- 4×4 grid with keyboard controls (↑ ↓ ← →)
- Random tile generation (2s and occasional 4s)
- **Undo** button to revert the last move
- **Reset** button to start a new game
- Instructions dialog on launch
- MVC-style architecture separating model (game logic), view (rendering), and controller (input)

## How Much Time I Spent
~**8 hours** (project setup, UI wiring, controls, testing)
~**2 hours** (rewriting lost parts of code, and implementing reset and undo buttons)
